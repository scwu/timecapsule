          <p>Dear Future Penn Computer Science,</p>
          <p>We are Penn's Women in Computer Science Board and we hope by the time you are reading this - the idea of having a Women in Computer Science club at all will be as ridiculous as having a Men in Computer Science club, today. Right now - Penn Computer Science is made up of only ~25% women (but we're watching this number grow steadily). We are desperately trying to find our place as a significant minority in Penn CS. WiCS, today, serves to address the issues that come with being a women in a hugely male dominated field. As women in CS, we spend some time worrying about imposter syndrome - we are sick of constantly questioning ourselves and why we are able to do what we do. We are absolutely concerned with (and tired of!) being seen more as a potential girlfriend than a colleague. We stress about brogramming (I don't even like beer, does that mean I don't belong in CS?) and how caring about what we wear will effect how our fellow (male) developers see us (will telling him I like clothes make him think I'm stupid?). Many of us grew up feeling like Computer Science was a "guy" thing - and we're still not sure if they were right or wrong. We feel stupid having to learn things we were never exposed to, that are "trivial" to other people, and we struggle with this a lot.</p>
          <p>We crave mentors - other females we can look up to and see - "hey, one day we can be just like them" - but right now, there aren't many to find in tech - Marissa Meyer and Sheryl Sanberg being the outstanding exceptions. We want this to change. We want there to be a time where guys in CS can't complain about the "perks" we, as women, get in hiring and recruiting, and in the same vein, we want companies to stop actively seeking women, to stop stressing about their first female hire, and put aside the frat-boy culture of many tech startups today. We want our Moore 100 social group to stop being a ridiculous 2:5 or 2:7 or whatever it is. We want to walk into Moore 100 and feel like we belong, we want to stop hearing the guys at Penn CS complain that there are no girls in their CS classes - and we absolutely want people to stop getting fired over awkward, uncomfortable dongle jokes.</p>
          <p>I hope in whatever year you are reading this, Penn CS will be as close to 50/50 as every other discipline in the College and Wharton. As much as I hope that Penn CS is today's Stanford or CMU, I hope even more that Penn CS has become a place where we don't have to worry about being called "hyper-sensitive" for being offended by jokes made about our gender, I hope that the reasons some women in Penn CS choose something else aren't that they feel like "everyone else knows so much" or that they feel like they aren't "part of the mafia" or "don't belong" - and are just because they don't enjoy programming. We want to go to hackathons where you can't count the number of women if you can't count the number of men - and we want to be able to sit in a team of all guys and not feel like we have to prove something.</p>
          <p>I hope this all seems so ridiculous to all of you reading this in the future, because these are the issues we have today and I believe in the future, and I believe this will all go away (soon!). I believe we should be paid equally, work equally, we can (and do!) code equally, and we are, as women in Computer Science, intellectual equals to men - and I really believe everyone in Computer Science is far too intelligent, intellectal and talented to accept the status quo as it is today. I hope it always stays this way.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I hope that the spirit of Penn CS stays the same - that you love each other the way we love each other, and that even if there are struggles - you know you can trust and turn to <em>everyone</em> in Computer Science at Penn the way I know I can. I hope that you still have Penn CS parties where everyone gets way too drunk, and morning brunches together in Hill (or where ever you guys get brunch) after a CS all-nighter. I hope that at least at Penn, if not the rest of the world, you have as strong and supportive of a community (one that has room for a minority organization like WiCS!) that we all had coming here. If all of this is not true - you should make it true. We believe in you.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>
